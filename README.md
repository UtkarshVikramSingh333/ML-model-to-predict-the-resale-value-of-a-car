# ML-model-to-predict-the-resale-value-of-a-car
Used ML model to predict the resale value of a car 
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the resale price of a car based on various features such as the car's name, location, manufacturing year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission type, owner type, mileage, engine capacity, and power. The goal was to create a reliable and accurate model that could assist in forecasting the market value of used cars based on historical data and key characteristics.

Data Preprocessing:
The project began with data cleaning and preprocessing. Missing values in features like mileage, engine capacity, and power were handled using imputation techniques. Categorical variables such as the car name, fuel type, transmission type, and owner type were encoded using One-Hot Encoding to transform them into numerical representations. For continuous variables such as kilometers driven, mileage, and engine power, I used feature scaling techniques like Standardization or Min-Max Scaling to normalize the data and ensure consistent scale across the features.

Feature Engineering:
To further enhance the model's accuracy, I performed feature engineering. For example, I extracted meaningful insights from the year column by calculating the car’s age at the time of resale, as the age of a car has a significant impact on its resale price. Additionally, features such as engine power and mileage were analyzed for their interaction with other variables like fuel type and transmission to capture the underlying relationships more effectively.

Model Selection and Training:
I employed various supervised learning regression algorithms to solve this problem, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and XGBoost. Cross-validation techniques were applied to split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data and avoids overfitting. I also applied Grid Search CV to tune the hyperparameters of the models, optimizing for factors like the number of decision trees, tree depth, and learning rates for models like Random Forest and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation:
The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. These evaluation metrics allowed me to compare the models and select the one with the best predictive accuracy. Additionally, I used Residual Plots to visually inspect the distribution of errors and ensure that the assumptions of linear regression were met where applicable.

Feature Importance:
One key aspect of this project was determining which features had the most significant impact on predicting the resale price of a car. By analyzing the feature importance from models like Random Forest and XGBoost, I was able to determine that variables such as the car’s age, kilometers driven, fuel type, and engine power were critical factors influencing the resale price. This provided valuable insights for understanding the car market and factors affecting depreciation.

Final Model and Insights:
The final model, after fine-tuning and evaluation, was able to predict car resale prices with a high degree of accuracy. This model could be used by dealerships and individuals to estimate the resale value of cars, helping both buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the used car market.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques, including regression algorithms, feature engineering, and model tuning, in the automotive industry, resulting in predictive insights that can help optimize pricing strategies and enhance decision-making in the used car market.
